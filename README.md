# Covid19_appointments

## Statement

#### Description:
Build a system that allows a user to request a covid-19 vaccination appointment, receive its confirmation and validate it at the day of the vaccination.

#### Considerations
You can code using your preferred languages, infrastructure, etc.
We will take into consideration your thoughts (not necessarily coded) in your solution for the following components:
- Front-end server
- Back-end server
- API interface
- Data persistence
- Security
- Code quality
- Scalability

#### Follow-up Instructions
- Upload your solution into a code repository (github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc.)
- Send us the repository link where you coded the exercise
- Expect to explain your exercise solution and perform a demo.


## Solution
- **Front-end server:**  Html and CSS
- **Back-end server, API interface:** Python, Django, SQLite3, GitHub and Heroku
- **Data persistence:** The database in Heroku keeps the data even after the app is closed, it would be nice to add some recurrent backup, this could be done maybe through Github Actions, the most correct would be to have our own DB's but the fastest solution I can think of owuld be to paste the DBs data it into a spreadsheet using gsheet.action maybe?
- **Security:** Django authentification and a good follow up would be to add HTTP end to end encryption, a way to do this would be with Heroku payment plans for example.
- **Code quality:** I followed best practices when writting the code, following a common Django file structure a good follow up would be to comment more the code if I had more time.
- **Scalability:**
